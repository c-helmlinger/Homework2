# MONTE CARLO SIMULTION-- Stock Market Importance
The Monte Carlo Simulation can be used to help onlookers interpret the stock market by using a form of "trial and error" to find the most accurate prediction of what stock return will look like in the future. Stock volatility can be hard to predict without the tools to show patterns and trends in the stock market, as well as make predictions based on these trends, one of these tools being the Monte Carlo Simulation. While the Candlestick Chart directly shows the past trends in stock returns and stock price and can be read to reflect patterns such as the "hammer," which may lead to a prediction that the stock price will begin to rise based on trends seen in the past, a Monte Carlo Simulation of a certain stock market can be used to directly predict what will happen in the stock price based on its accuracy of past stock market trends. The Monte Carlo Simulation, after having gone through many generations to reach the best depiction of the trends of the stock market, is capable of providing great insight into the future trends of stock prices and can therefore help investors and traders know what their next decisions involving stock trade should be.
